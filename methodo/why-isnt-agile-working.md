1. Flow Efficiency
Lead time from idea => reach customer
Most time spent waiting, only 15% or work (40% very best)

2. Unplanned Work and Multitasking
Unplanned work and task switching: 75% interest.
Often not even accounted for in ticketing

3. S, M, and L
“size” of the work almost unrelated to time-to-completion
Too many other factors influencing time-to-completion (dependencies, unplanned work, lots of work in progress, CI/CD...)

4. Benefits Realization
Point is not to go faster, it's to reduce delivery risk
Risk is "on time / within scope"

5. Unmanaged Complexity
Reference feature takes longer to complete as the system grows.
Managing complexity / refactoring / automation

CONCLUSION
---
Agile is worthless unless it serves as a catalyst for continuous improvement.
