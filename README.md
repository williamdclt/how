## What is this

A simple hand-made knowledge management tool. I use it mostly to not down one-liners, bash commands, useful tricks that are too complex to remember.

## How to use it

- Add `how.sh` to your path (I also aliased it to `?`)
    - There's a few dependencies: `fzf` and `bat`
- Create a new entry: `how.sh new <entry>`, eg `how.sh new bash/file-process-substitution`
- Edit an entry: `how.sh new [entry]`
- Search entries: `how.sh [entry]`
- Delete an entry: `how.sh delete [entry]`
